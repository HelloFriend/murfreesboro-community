# Murfreesboro Community
A repository for community resources and collaboration hub for the city of Murfreesboro, Tennessee, USA

## Purpose
To provide an open source channel for individuals who want to get involved in the local community and help
others do the same.

## Participating:

If you'd like to participate, please add your information to [`humans.txt`](humans.txt) and submit a pull request.

We use a writing format called Markdown to write articles and proposals. Read [the Daring Fireball Guide to Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) to get a handle on that.

Since this is a totally new idea, we're making it up as we go. That being said, I see a basic framework as being helpful. To make and addition or a revision, simply fork this repository, make your changes, and issue a pull request.

If you want someone else to do something, create an issue and someone can step in and work on it.

Here's an example: You notice a typo on this page and it's an easy fix, so you fork the repo and make a few changes. now that you have your own version of the repository that fixes an issue in the current main version, you can issue a pull request which effectively says "hey, include my changes in the main version!". Someone with admin powers will approve the request and your changes will go live.

Now, while you were updating the readme file and fixing typos, you had a genuis idea: someone should teach a basic typing class in town. You can submit a "issue" ticket and tag it with "idea". Now, someone else might be looking at the site and decide that they have way too much free time. They decide that teaching your class would be a great idea. They write up a proposal for it and submit it to the repository where it's available for everyone to see.

There are a bunch of resources for learning how to do all this stuff, and I plan to teach a workshop. Check out issue #1 to see how the process plays out.
